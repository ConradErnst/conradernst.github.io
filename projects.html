      <b> Computer Vision based Virtual Therapist </b>
      <p>As part of a collaborative Computer Science capstone project, I contributed to developing an immersive 
        generative AI platform designed to provide college students with a supportive, interactive virtual 
        therapist experience. The project integrated real-time emotion detection, a fine-tuned large language 
        model (LLM), synchronized facial animations, and speech synthesis to create a dynamic and responsive 
        conversational environment. I led the model development and integration efforts, including designing and 
        training an LLM for therapeutic dialogue, and utilized APIs for generating AI-driven video and synthesized 
        speech. This platform, inspired by applications like Zoom, reimagined virtual communication with fully 
        generative AI capabilities, enhancing empathetic, real-time interaction.</p>

      <b> RAG-Based Educational Generative AI</b>
      <p>As part of Advanced NLP course, I developed an educational content generation system utilizing retrieval-augmented 
        generation (RAG) with a pretrained LLM, seamlessly integrated with a knowledge base 
        to enhance the creation of generative lecture material. This system automated the 
        production of topic-specific PowerPoint presentations, enabling efficient generation of 
        college-level content across various subjects. By leveraging RAG, the project advanced 
        the use of personalized, generative educational materials, providing a streamlined 
        approach to instructional content delivery.</p>

      <b>Visualizing Text-to-Image Generative AI</b>
      <p>In collaboration with my AI capstone team, I helped develop an interactive web application that 
      illustrates the workings of diffusion-based text-to-image generative AI, offering users an in-depth 
      look into the image creation process. The application features a visual model on the front end,
       displaying diffused images across various epoch steps and allowing users to adjust hyperparameters 
       and input prompts to experiment with model behavior. This project combined visual aids with explanatory 
       text to enhance user comprehension of complex AI concepts through hands-on exploration.</p>
