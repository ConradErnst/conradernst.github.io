			I am a research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder in the <a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/"> Programming 
			Language and Verification Lab </a> in Boulder, Colorado. I am honored to be co-advised by Alvaro Velasquez and Ashutosh Trivedi. 
			Earlier, I graduated in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Aritifical Intelligence from Drake University.

			My research focuses on understanding, improving, and explaining planning and reasoning in large language models (LLMs), 
			with a specific emphasis on leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and neurosymbolic AI to enhance their capabilities and 
			interpretability. A key goal is to develop methods for verifying the correctness and robustness of these systems, ensuring 
			they work as intended across diverse and complex tasks. I also explore the use of formal methods to compress and optimize 
			these models, maintaining their functionality while reducing computational requirements. By integrating these approaches, 
			I aim to guide LLMs toward becoming more reliable, efficient, and trustworthy systems, capable of supporting high-stakes 
			applications in a transparent and predictable manner.

			If you'd like to discuss my research, explore potential collaborations or business endeavors, or request a copy of my CV, 
			please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to meaningful conversations and opportunities!
